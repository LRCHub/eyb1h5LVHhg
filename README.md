> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I can hear the bell of fate sounds
It's high time to turn it around
Will the prophecy manifest
Will I be the maiden who's blessed

Then I'll walk down the glory path
Bring honor and brightness back
Wipe out all the enemies in sight
There's no turning back this time

Will it realize, Will it realize
Will the laurel be placed on my head
One day we shall cheer and dance
Making joy forever last

Then I'll walk down the glory path
Bring honor and brightness back
Wipe out all the enemies in sight
There's no turning back this time

Will it realize, Will it realize
Will the laurel be placed on my head
One day we shall cheer and dance
Making joy forever last
